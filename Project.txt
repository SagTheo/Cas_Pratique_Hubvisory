Thought process:

-> figuring out how the api works (retrieving names and pictures of actors and movies)
        -> actor: https://api.themoviedb.org/3/person/${personId}?api_key=${apiKey}
        -> actor picture: https://api.themoviedb.org/3/person/${personId}/images?api_key=${apiKey}
        -> movie: https://api.themoviedb.org/3/movie/${movieId}/images?api_key=${apiKey}
        -> movie picture: https://api.themoviedb.org/3/movie/${movieId}?api_key=${apiKey}

-> figuring out a way to build the quizz
        -> ideas:
            Issue#1 --> when app starts, ids of all the actors and movies are retrieved and stored in array
                        --> found a better way:
                            -possible to download all valid ids there:
                                    -http://files.tmdb.org/p/exports/movie_ids_MM_DD_YYYY.json.gz
                                    -http://files.tmdb.org/p/exports/person_ids_MM_DD_YYYY.json.gz
                            - wrote script to retrieve the first 100000 movie and person ids and 
                              place them in an array (see ids folder)
                                    
                            -> for actors: request should filter out items which "known_for_department" property !== "Acting"
                                and items which have "status_code" property

            -one id from actors array and one id from movies array are picked randomly
            -question is displayed with actor's name and movie's name based on those ids (along with pictures)
            -user answers yes or no
            -server checks answer thanks to the ids
                -> server calls https://api.themoviedb.org/3/person/{person_id}/movie_credits?api_key=<<api_key>>&language=en-US
                -> filters the response to look for the movie id 
                -> if movie id found : correct answer, if not : wrong answer
                -> server sends back yes or no
                -> server response compared to user answer

-> to display score after a game and save it in-between attempts:
                --> use React Context API ?
